Raising Awareness, Educating, and Motivating for Sustainable Recycling
</h2>

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

A significant percentage of critical raw materials, including Lithium, are not recycled due to a lack of awareness and correct recycling practices. This not only harms the environment but also poses a threat to supply chains and sustainability. Our solution aims to address this issue by creating an innovative Instagram filter that combines awareness, education, and motivation to encourage sustainable recycling.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Using the power of Instagram, we deploy our solution as a filter that users can share as Instagram stories or reels. The filter employs cutting-edge object detection and classification technology, including OpenAI GPT-4 Vision and GPT-4 Turbo, to provide users with insights into the impact of recycling. It also guides them to the nearest recycling stations. To motivate users, we offer point rewards that can be redeemed as perks from partner companies. These companies, in turn, support our initiative by advertising through content generated by our filter.
